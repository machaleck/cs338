5)
The frame content is 60200 23-09-13 19:18:30 50 0 0 150.6 UTC(NIST) *
60200 is the Modified Julian Date (the number of whole days since midnight on November 17, 1858)
23-09-13 is the date (September 13, 2023)
19:18:30 is the time in hours, minutes, and seconds in Coordinated Universal Time
50 means daylight savings time
The first 0 states that no leap second will be added or subtracted at midnight on the last day of the current month
The second 0 represents the health of the service (0 means healthy)
150.6 is the number of milliseconds that NIST adds to the time to roughly compensate for network delays
UTC(NIST) indicates that the time uses the UTC(NIST) time scale

6)
[SYN] (synchronize) is a TCP packet sent to another computer requesting that a connection be established between them

7)
[ACK] (acknowledgement) is a signal that a device sends to indicate that data has been received successfully

8)
[FIN] (finish) is used to request for connection termination

9)
The nc client initiated the closing of the TCP connection because the client sent the [FIN] signal. The client can be identified as the sender of this message because the source IP matches the client's IP.

===== HTTP =====
1)
3 TCP connections were opened since there were 3 SYN requests from the client
